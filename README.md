# PowerShell Conference Europe - TabExpansionPlusPlus in examples.
This repository contains files used during demos for Tab++ session.
You can find some history here...

1. First Tab++ with 'fake' attribute.
2. Currently used Register-ArgumentCompleter approach.
3. Future **real** argumentCompleter attribute.

Should help getting up-to-speed with TabExpansionPlusPlus module and build-in v5 Tab++ features.
